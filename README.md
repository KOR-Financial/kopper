# Kopper
Kopper is an example project for demonstrating various use cases around abstracting and evolving wire formats

## Disclaimer
Kopper is not necessarily production-ready code. It lays out ways to implement conceptual patterns around schema evolution. Kopper is open to community contributions and interactions, and can over time become hardened enough to qualify for production use cases.

## Why

Working with a wire format is hard, especially if this wire format is also
our storage format. Therefor it becomes a burden to evolve these formats.
